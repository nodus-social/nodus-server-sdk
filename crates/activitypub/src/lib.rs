//! ActivityPub objects and the public reader.
//!
//! This crate is deliberately separate from the client adapters in `nodus-sdk`:
//! Mastodon's REST API and ActivityPub are different protocols with different shapes, and
//! keeping them apart stops one protocol's quirks leaking into the other. The reader only
//! reads public objects; signing and delivering activities live in `nodus-federation`.
